# Master-Slave Architecture Requirements
# Core dependencies for the Master-Slave trading system

# Python version
python>=3.8

# Core dependencies
asyncio

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
# statistics (built-in)
# datetime (built-in)
# typing (built-in)
# dataclasses (built-in)

# Note: This architecture is designed to work with the existing
# TradingAgents-crypto dependencies and adds minimal new requirements

# For production deployment, consider adding:
# - Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
# - Logging (structlog)
# - Configuration management (pydantic)
# - Database (SQLAlchemy, Redis)
# - Message queue (Redis, RabbitMQ)
